# Patient_Health_management_portal

The Patient Health Management Portal is likely a web-based platform that allows patients to manage their health information, communicate with their healthcare providers,
and access educational resources. The goal of this platform is to improve patient engagement, promote self-management, and support the delivery of coordinated, 
high-quality care.

The platform could include features such as:

- Personal health record: allows patients to store and access their health information, including medications, allergies, test results, and immunization records.
- Secure messaging: enables patients to communicate with their healthcare providers, ask questions, and receive timely responses.
- Appointments and reminders: helps patients schedule appointments, manage their calendar, and receive reminders for important health-related tasks.
- Health education resources: provides patients with access to educational materials, videos, and articles on various health topics.
